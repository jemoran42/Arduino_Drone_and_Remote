# Arduino_Drone_and_Remote
Quadcopter flight controller and remote control utilizing Arduino Nano and RF module. This repo is mostly just a personal backup but can hopefully be a starting point for other's and their ideas.

# Notes
Some of the files require additional Arduino libraries for the software to build and run. Additional library includes the RF24 module library.

# Installing libraries
Go to https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24.git and either:

Download the zip folder and extract into the "Arduino/libraries/" directory

OR

use git and clone the folder directly into the "Arduino/libraries/" directory.
