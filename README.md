# Arduino_Drone_and_Remote
Quadcopter flight controller and remote control utilizing Arduino Nano and RF module. This repo is mostly just a personal backup but can hopefully be a starting point for other's and their ideas.

# Notes
Some of the files require additional Arduino libraries for the software to build and run. Additional library includes the RF24 module library.
